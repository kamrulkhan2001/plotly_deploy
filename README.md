Belly Button Biodiversity

Overview of the Belly Button Biodiversity Project
For this project, we created adashboard that visualizes the bacterial data for each Improbable Beef project volunteer.
We uitilized our knowlege of JavaScript and Plotly to create a dynamic HTML page.

Results
The final product is a webpage of Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard that is stylistic and filters the data based on the individual volunteer's ID number. The filtered data shows that top 10 bacterial cultures found, belly button washing frequency and bacteria cultures found per sample.
